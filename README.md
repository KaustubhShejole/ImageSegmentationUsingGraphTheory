# ImageSegmentationUsingGraphTheory

This project was done by Mr. Kaustubh Shivshankar Shejole under the guidance of Dr. Gaurav Mishra at Computer Science and Engineering,
VNIT Nagpur. 
The work proposes a novel maximum spanning tree based Image segmentation leveraging low-level segmentation as Mean-Shift segmentation.

The work also proposes an efficient similarity measure between pixel segments that have a complexity linear in the number of bins in color space.

The results demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.

We worked with two low-level segmentation approaches, Mean-Shift and SLIC and found out that Mean-Shift gives better segments.


We used two datasets:
1. Oxford 102 flower dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/
2. EG1800 Portrait Dataset available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18xM3jU2dSp1DiDqEM6PVXattNMZvsX4z/view?usp=sharing
