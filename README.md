# ImageSegmentationUsingGraphTheory

This project was done by Mr. Kaustubh Shivshankar Shejole under the guidance of Dr. Gaurav Mishra at Computer Science and Engineering,
VNIT Nagpur. 
The work proposes a novel maximum spanning tree based Image segmentation leveraging low-level segmentation as Mean-Shift segmentation.

The work also proposes an efficient similarity measure between pixel segments that have a complexity linear in numver of bins in color space.

The results demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.
